<p>wow <code>htmltab</code> is very efficient !</p>
<p>Now we need to wrangle <code>algae</code> in order to make it tidy (1 row = 1 observation) so analysis can be performed more easily.</p>

<p>We can extract the first word <code>Specy</code> to get the Genus, maybe we can see some trends that are true for some Genus.</p>

<p>this dashboard was designed more for data exploration than knowledge presentation. The hypothesis I was able to make based on simply exploration through visualisation are :</p>
<div id="hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>{{&lt; alert info no-icon &gt;}} 1. As only 9 algaes can grow at 5C and 15C at 10C on a total of 19 species, temperature seems to be the most important factor for algae growth. 2. More light is not directly linked to more growth, instead, it looks like a genus or specy preference. {{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
</div>
<div id="facts" class="section level3">
<h3>Facts</h3>
<p>{{&lt; alert success &gt;}} 2. Saying that I cannot control Light and Temperature and these variables vary from their minimum and maximum during the year, the best growing algae is <strong>Chlorella ellipsoidea</strong> as its mean growthrate is the highest. {{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis-testing" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis testing</h2>
<p>We are back in R in order to model the temperature effect on algae growth for any Light condition.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#lets plot that
box1 &lt;- ggplot(algae, aes(fct_inorder(Temperature), GrowthRate))+
geom_boxplot(aes(group=Temperature), outlier.alpha = 0.4)

box2 &lt;- ggplot(algae, aes((Light), GrowthRate))+
geom_boxplot(aes(group=Light), outlier.alpha = 0.4)+theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())

box1 + box2</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://felixmil.github.io/post/2018-01-20-first-article-and-entry-for-r-dataisbeautiful-dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We see a global tendency of Growthrate increasing as Temperature increases. As for Light, nothing clear emerge from this representation.</p>
<p>In order to assess and quantify the effect of Temperature and light on algae growth, we fit an anova model :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fitanova &lt;- aov(algae$GrowthRate~algae$Temperature*algae$Light+algae$Light*algae$Temperature)
summary(fitanova)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    
## algae$Temperature               3  5.811  1.9368  21.722 1.19e-11 ***
## algae$Light                     1  0.000  0.0003   0.003    0.956    
## algae$Temperature:algae$Light   3  0.052  0.0173   0.194    0.900    
## Residuals                     143 12.750  0.0892

## 1 observation deleted due to missingness</code></pre>
<p>The results of this modelisation tell us that only temperature has significant effet on growth (or that we don’t have enough evidence to show Light effects if you prefer).</p>
<p>If we consider Temperature effect as continuous and build a linear model, we can provide a rough effect quantification on growth :</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fitlm &lt;- lm(algae$GrowthRate~algae$Temperature)

ggplot(algae, aes(as.numeric(levels(Temperature)[Temperature]), GrowthRate))+geom_point(aes(color=Genus))+geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;)+
stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom=&quot;line&quot;, aes(group=Genus, color=Genus))+labs(title =paste(&quot;Growthrate =&quot;,signif(fitlm$coef[[2]], 3),&quot;* Temperature +&quot;,signif(fitlm$coef[[1]],3 )), subtitle=paste(&quot;Adj R2 = &quot;,signif(summary(fitlm)$adj.r.squared, 5), &quot; p-value =&quot;,signif(summary(fitlm)$coef[2,4], 5)))+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5))</code></pre>

<p>{{&lt; alert warning &gt;}} I am not rigorously sure about this assumption of effect quantification, so if i’m wrong please, contact me on twitter {{&lt; /alert &gt;}}</p>

<p>Although this chart is OK, it is far from finished, and I still spent about 2 hours to get it ! This is why I think combining R and Tableau is good for knowledge discovery process. R for data wrangling, tidying and summary ; Tableau for quick visualisations and experimentations on data. Then I usually come back to R to build a more precise and customized visualisation when Tableau doesn’t fill my needs.</p>
